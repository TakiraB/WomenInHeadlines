Project Title: Analyzing Bias in News Headlines About Women

Project Description:

This project is a comprehensive analysis of bias in news headlines about women from four major countries, driven by the use of various Machine Learning tools and data visualization techniques. The primary objective was to evaluate and measure potential bias towards women within these headlines, employing a rigorous data preprocessing and cleaning approach to enhance dataset quality and reliability.

Key Project Highlights:

Diverse Headline Dataset: The project began with the acquisition and compilation of a diverse dataset containing news headlines about women from four significant countries. This dataset served as the foundation for the subsequent analysis.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the dataset, a thorough data preprocessing and cleaning phase was executed. This involved tasks like handling missing data, removing duplicates, and standardizing text formats.

Sentiment Analysis with Vader: Leveraging the Python-based Vader sentiment analysis tool, the project performed a sentiment analysis on the headlines within the dataset. By assessing the polarity of the headlines, the analysis provided valuable insights into the public sentiment associated with the content. This was crucial in identifying the positivity or negativity of the news coverage.

Data Visualization: To make the findings more accessible and engaging, data visualization played a significant role. Popular libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to create informative and visually appealing charts, graphs, and interactive graphics. These visualizations helped in presenting the project's results in an easily consumable format, aiding in conveying the insights to a broader audience.

Project Objectives:

Measure bias towards women in news headlines.
Assess the overall sentiment of the headlines and identify any potential trends.
Convey the results through compelling and understandable data visualizations.
Raise awareness about the importance of unbiased reporting in news media.
This project not only sheds light on the issue of bias in news reporting but also demonstrates the power of machine learning and data visualization in analyzing and presenting complex data. The insights derived from this analysis can be valuable in discussions about gender bias and the role of media in shaping public opinion.
